Thoughts on potential tasks:  

1) Choose a small wiki to start with.  
2) Define a family of packages:   
  2a. one per article (with all of its discussions + templates + categories + revisions)  
  2b. one per namespace for the 'catalog of articles' in that namespace, updated as pages are moved and deleted and created  
  (depending on the package for each article),  
  2c. one for the whole wiki, with data about the wiki itself and a last-updated timestamp.  
  (depending on the article catalog, and catalogs for other namespaces)  
3) Invite a group of interested people to write scripts that produce these packages.  
  Each might be updated on a different cadence. by a script reading from the same event stream.
